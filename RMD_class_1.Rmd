# EXERCISE 1

Pick a TV show that had its premieres on TV and thus has some viewership numbers reported on Wikipedia.
E.g. [Suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Suits_episodes) (see table just above the References)

Then create a short report (you can copy the content from Wikipedia or other pages for this task) that contains, for example:

1. A brief description of the show (use _italics_ for names).
2. A photo with the logo or a shot from the show itself.
3. A summary of some basic statistics (e.g. on viewership or ratings).
4. A graph of the viewership over time.
5. A graph of the episode-to-episode (or season-to-season) changes in viewership.
6. A short description of the observed changes that includes inline references to numbers (e.g. the viewership decreased by `insert_calculated_number` between seasons 3 and 5).
7. Make sure your report looks nice -> this time we're mostly interested in the output and not necessarily the codes used to achieve it.
7. `knitr` your report and save it in the "RMarkdown folder" of your repo. 
8. Commit the changes and push them to Github.
9. Send a link to your course repo to your course tutor - thanks!

### Some other chunk options

E.g.:

- `highlight` -- syntax coloring

- `tidy`-- clean and format the code based on, e.g. `formatR` or `styler`, with specific options defined by `tidy.opts`

For chunks with figures, e.g.:

- `fig.align` -- alignment

- `fig.ext` -- image format

- `dev` -- graphical device for the plot generation

- `dev.args`-- arguments to be passed to device (e.g. for image customisation)

- `dpi` -- DPI

You can, e.g., combine the above to produce images in DPI resolution and format appropriate for a publication.
