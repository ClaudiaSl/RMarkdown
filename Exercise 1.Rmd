## Season-to-season changes in mean viewership

Below plot presents the changes in viewership across seasons starting from the 1st to the 5th.
```{r, fig.width=5,fig.height=5, fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

df <- data.frame(season=c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5"),
                views_mean=c(1.04, 1.09, 1.51, 1.07, 0.81))

ggplot(data=df, aes(x=season, y=views_mean)) +
  geom_line(aes(group=1), color = "blue")+
  labs(title="Outlander changes in average viewership",x="Season", y = "Viewership [in mln]")


```
```{r, echo=FALSE}

m_views <- max(df$views)
l_views <- min(df$views)
range <- max(df$views) - min(df$views)

```

## Conclusion

The most popular season was season 3 (average viewership equals `r m_views` mln). The least popular was season 5 (average viewership equals `r l_views` mln). The difference between them equals `r range` mln views.
